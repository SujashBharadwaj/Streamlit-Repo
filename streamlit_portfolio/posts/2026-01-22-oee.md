Working at an integrated IoT company has pushed me to think beyond dashboards and “nice charts” — and into metrics that actually move manufacturing outcomes. One metric that came up immediately is **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**.

OEE is simple on paper, but powerful in practice: it turns the messy reality of shop-floor losses into a single number you can track — *and* a breakdown you can act on.

---

## What is OEE?

**Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** measures how effectively a machine (or line) is used compared to its full potential during the time it is scheduled to run. At a high level:

- **100% OEE** means:
  - no downtime (Availability = 100%)
  - running at ideal speed (Performance = 100%)
  - producing only good parts (Quality = 100%)

This “perfect production” framing is widely used and is a good mental model when you introduce OEE to a team. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## A quick history (where OEE comes from)

OEE is strongly associated with **Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)** and the broader lean manufacturing movement. It became popular as a structured way to quantify and reduce equipment-related losses, and it is commonly attributed to TPM literature and manufacturing improvement practices from the late 20th century. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The key idea that made OEE “stick” is this:

Instead of arguing about productivity in general, you track **where time and output are being lost**, using a standardized breakdown.

---

## The OEE formula (and what each part means)

OEE is the product of three factors:

**OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 1) Availability
Availability asks: **Was the machine running when it was supposed to run?**

A common definition is:

**Availability = Run Time / Planned Production Time** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

This captures downtime losses like breakdowns, setups, changeovers, waiting on maintenance, etc.

### 2) Performance
Performance asks: **When it was running, did it run at ideal speed?**

A common definition is:

**Performance = (Total Count × Ideal Cycle Time) / Run Time** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This captures speed losses like micro-stops, reduced speed, minor jams, slow feeding, etc.

### 3) Quality
Quality asks: **How much output was actually good?**

A common definition is:

**Quality = Good Count / Total Count** :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

This captures scrap, rework, defects, and startup rejects.

## A practical example (with numbers)

Assume for one shift:

- Planned Production Time = 480 min
- Downtime = 60 min → Run Time = 420 min
- Total Count = 1000 units
- Good Count = 950 units
- Ideal Cycle Time = 0.4 min/unit (24 sec/unit)

Availability:
- A = 420 / 480 = 0.875

Performance:
- P = (1000 × 0.4) / 420 = 400 / 420 = 0.952

Quality:
- Q = 950 / 1000 = 0.95

OEE:
- OEE = 0.875 × 0.952 × 0.95 = 0.792 → **79.2%**

This is the main value of OEE: one number *and* a clear breakdown of where you’re losing output.

---

## Why OEE is still relevant (especially now)

OEE remains “best practice” because it does two important things:

1) **It converts losses into categories people can fix**
   - downtime → availability loss
   - slow running / micro-stops → performance loss
   - defects / rework → quality loss :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

2) **It gives a consistent baseline**
   Teams can benchmark and improve the same machine over time, across shifts, and across plants (carefully). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## The “Six Big Losses” idea (why teams love OEE)

OEE is often paired with the “Six Big Losses” framework, which maps common manufacturing losses into the three OEE buckets (Availability, Performance, Quality). This helps teams move from “the line is bad” to “we’re losing speed due to micro-stops” or “scrap spikes during startup.” :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## What is a “good” OEE score?

Be careful here: OEE depends on industry, product mix, and how strictly you define time and loss categories.

A commonly cited reference is:
- **85%** as “world-class” (often used as a target, not a universal truth) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

The better mindset is:
- Don’t obsess over the absolute number.
- Obsess over **whether you can improve it**, and whether the loss breakdown is trustworthy. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## The IoT angle: what you must get right (or OEE becomes meaningless)

If you’re measuring OEE from integrated IoT + shop-floor systems, accuracy depends on definitions:

- What exactly counts as **Planned Production Time**?
- How do you detect **Run vs Stop**?
- What threshold turns a “micro-stop” into downtime?
- Is **Ideal Cycle Time** validated per SKU / recipe / product type?
- Do you trust the **Good vs Total** count sources? (MES, QC station, manual logs?)

Garbage definitions → garbage OEE.
